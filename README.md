Abstract
Background: Portable technology that records movements with high accuracy provides potential for sensitive clinical movement tests for individuals who experienced a traumatic brain injury (TBI). The purpose of this research was to 1) present impairments assessed using markerless motion capture (MMC), and 2) compare the sensitivity of the MMC-mediated tests to each other and to common clinical tests. 
Methods: Thirty individuals with TBI completed the MMC-mediated tests, which included finger oscillation, simple reaction time, and visually guided movement tasks. For comparison, subjects also completed the following clinical tests: Halstead-Reitan finger tapping, simple reaction time test, and Beery Visuomotor Integration test. 
Results: MMC-mediated tests revealed impairments in more subjects than clinical tests: 83% of subjects with TBI fell outside of cut-off scores on MMC-mediated tests, compared to 53% on clinical tests. Additionally, a random forest classification showed that MMC-mediated tests were more sensitive, yielding an out-of-bag error rate of 9.1% for the MMC-mediated tests and 19.7% for the clinical tests. However, MMC-mediated tests also identified more impairments among control subjects: 18% of control subjects fell outside of cut-off scores on MMC-mediated tests, compared to 10% on clinical tests. 
Conclusion: These findings suggest that MMC-mediated tests are sensitive and could be useful in clinical practice.
