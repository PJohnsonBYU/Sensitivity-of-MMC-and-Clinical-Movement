This respository contains data collected for the study titled _"Comparing the Sensitivity of Novel Motor Assessments for Traumatic Brain Injury"_

Principle Investigator- Paula Johnson, PhD
Sr. Author - Steven Charles, PhD
This data was collected at Brigham Young University and University of Utah with approval from the Instituitional Review Board for each site. 

Questions regarding this data can be directed to Dr. Paula Johnson at paula.johnson@rm.edu.

The procedures for capturing the raw data from the Leap Motion Controller (Leap Motion, San Francisco, CA) and processing it to the final measures reported this repository can be found in the following article:

**Abbreviations and attributes for the reported measures:**

Markerless Motion Capture Tests
Finger oscillation measures:
	FO Count: Average number of times cursor crossed the 15mm gap in 10 seconds
*FO VPeriod: Variability in period; the standard deviation of the oscillation period 
*FO VAmp: Variability in amplitudd; the standard deviation of oscillation amplitude
  
Reaction time
	MMC RxnTime: Markerless Motion capature of simple reaction time; the time to move 15mm after onset of visual cue
	
Visually guided movement
	VGM Dysmetria: Endpoint error, defined as the distance between the center of the cursor at the end of the movement and the edge of the target, normalized by the distance between the cursor at the onset of the movement and the edge of the target 
	VGM Path Ratio: Ratio of the path length to the direct distance between the onset position and the position at the end of movement 
	VG MxSp: Maximum speed of finger between onset and end of movement

Clinical tests
Halstead-Reitan Finger tapping test
	HRFTT:The average number of taps on a mechanical counter in 10s

Clin RxnTim: Clinical Reaction Time; the time between appearance of a green light appearing on a computer screen and a keyboard press (space key) on a standard computer keyboard

Beery Visual-motor integration
  VMI SS: Visual motor integration standard score; the extent to which an individual can integrate visual and motor abilities

Grip strength
  GripStrngth: the force generated while squeezing a hand dynamometer
