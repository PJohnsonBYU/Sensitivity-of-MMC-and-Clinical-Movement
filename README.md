This data was collected at Brigham Young University and University of Utah with approval from the Instituitional Review Board for each site. 

The procedures for capturing the raw data from the Leap Motion Controller (Leap Motion, San Francisco, CA) and processing it to the final measures reported this repository can be found in the following article:
